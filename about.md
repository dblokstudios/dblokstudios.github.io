Founded in 2011, we aim to bring you quality events as well as an affordable and state of the art studio space for all your recording and mastering needs!

D-Blok Studios started as the brain child of two Duncan-ites, who wanted to bring a new face and fresh attitude to our local music scene. They started production on a brand new studio, built to bring an affordable way to get your demos out, master your tracks, or even just get feedback!

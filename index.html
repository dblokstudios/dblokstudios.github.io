          <h3>Abstrakt Sonance</h3>
          <p>A force like no other in the bass music world. Slaying every genre, plus experimenting into uncharted realms, Abstrakt is still very known world wide with his Dubstep and Drum & Bass. His influences and attitude were born from years of absolute madness, abuse, drugs, near death and a desire to use these negatives as a positive and create something new, something that constantly evolves with him on his new life. His mind is now on a focused path to constantly create and share his message and music with the world. With constant shows, and tours slowly tracing around the globe, Abstrakt will no doubt be a name, and a face, you wont soon forget.</p>

          <h3>Spoon</h3>
          <p>Homebreakin Records, East Van Digital
          <p>aka Shawn Spoor has been moving dance floors all over Vancouver Island, with his mixed varieties of drum and bass and broken beats since 2006. Whether it be festivals, bush parties, club nights or house parties, you'll never know what this boy is going to throw at you next. He always knows how to read a crowd and rock a dance floor! Spoon is not one to be missed!</p>
